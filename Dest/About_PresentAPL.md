## About PresentAPL

## PresentAPL -1-

* **PresentAPL** is a Dyalog class.
* It takes a Markdown file as input
* It uses MarkAPL to parse the Markdown.
* It creates a slide show from the Markdown. 
* It uses HTML5, CSS and a bit of JavaScript to achieve that.
* All it needs is a modern browser.  


## PresentAPL -2-

* Creates a slide show (or presentation) from a Markdown file.
* Uses the MarkAPL class (parser) for the conversion.
* See the Markdown file this presentation was created from as a template.
* There is a file `Example.md` available discussing all formatting options.
* There is an EXE available and a class script.
* In order to use the EXE you don't even need Dyalog APL.

One can use all the stuff supported by MarkAPL: paragraphs, lists, code blocks, tables, images, blockquotes, horizontal rulers, in-line markup (**bold**, _italic_, `APL code`, ~~deleted~~...) and more.


<div class="handout">

This is a paragraph **with** in-line mark-up that shows in print view only. The blank lines above and underneath this paragraph are essential. Only then are the two `<div>`s recognized as two rather than one HTML block, and only then is anything between the two `<div>`s interpreted as Markdown. 

</div>


## Advantages  

* Single stand-alone HTML file.
* It's just HTML5, CSS and a bit of JavaScript.
* Open Source.
* Simple and easy to use.
* Allows testing code expressions used in a presentation. 

‚çù This file acts also as an example of how to create such a slide show.


## Disadvantages
* No animations other than animated GIFs.


## Workflow

1. Create a presentation by editing a Markdown file. `AboutPresentAPL.md` is an excellent starting point
2. Drag the `*.md` file onto `PresentAPL.exe`
3. View the resulting HTML file - your presentation.


## Keyboard shortcuts

The following keys are used to control a PresentAPL presentation:{.nonincremental}

| Key        | Comment |
| - | - |
| <PgDn> | Show the next slide |
| <PgUp> | Show previous slide | 
| <Home>| First slide |
| <End>	  | Last slide |
| Cursor-right | Show next item |
| Cursor-left | Hide current item | 
| M	         | Toggle mouse navigation (default=off) |
| S | Toggle status bar visibility |
| P  | For "Print": shows all slides at once including any `<div>`s of the class "handout". 

## Incremental

* All elements are always incremental.

  That means that by pressing <CursorRight> just one element at a time is revealed.
  
* If you don't want this just press <PgDn> - this shows a whole slide at once.
  
## Misc

I like to know when the last topic on a slide has been revealed.

The bottom-left corner shows an arrow as long as not all items are revealed.
